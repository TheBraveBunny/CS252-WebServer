Part 1:
1. wrong flags, no port num, etc

Part 3:
1. Loadable modules
	- keep from reloading the same module multiple times
2. Extra credit
3. Implement post



- clean up code
- comment
- double check everything


not robust for -t after many many refreshes, and can't run on mozilla for seemingly same reason
	maybe only for -t flag
